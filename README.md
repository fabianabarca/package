# A New Package: Start Here

A template for creating a new Python package with documentation, using `setuptools` and `Sphinx`.

My preferences:

- Code style (PEP-8): Black
- Documentation style (docstrings): Numpy
- Sphinx web template: sphinx-book-theme
- License: MIT (default)

## Structure

```
package/
├─ data/
├─ docs/
│  ├─ build/
│  ├─ conf.py
│  ├─ index.rst
│  ├─ guide.rst
│  ├─ module.rst
│  ├─ make.bat
│  ├─ Makefile
├─ package/
│  ├─ index.css
│  ├─ index.js
├─ setup.py
├─ .gitignore
├─ README.md
```

where:

- `data/`: any data that the package may need to operate
- `docs/`: documentation files, as needed by Sphinx
    - `conf.py`: configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder
    - `index.rst`: package documentation master file
    - `_static/`: CSS, JavaScript files
    - `_templates/`: 
    - `make.bat` and `Makefile`: enablers of the commands `make html` and `make clean html`, to quickly create and/or update the documentation
    - `build/`: web documents generated by Sphinx, including `index.html`
- `package/`: source files of the modules of the package
    - `module.py`: most likely, packages are made of one or more modules, separated by functionality. They "do something"
- `dist/`: distribution files of the package, created by `setuptools`
- `setup.py`: setup of the `setuptools`package generator

## About the package creation with `setuptools`

Once `setup.py` has been configured, a package can be created with:

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

This will create or update a `dist/` folder with the [wheel](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/) file that makes installation of the package work and a `.tar.gz` file. There will also be a `package.egg-info` file but these are not included in the Git repository.

### Uploading the package to PyPI

After generating the distribution files, the next step would be to upload the distribution so others can use it. This functionality is provided by [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine) and is documented in the [Python packaging tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

## About the documentation with Sphinx

Sphinx can be quick-started with the command:

```bash
$ sphinx-quickstart
```

The rest of instructions are [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html).

[New themes](https://sphinx-themes.org/) must be installed via `pip`, first. This template uses:

```bash
$ pip install sphinx-book-theme
```

To create the web documentation, on the terminal, on the `docs/` folder (where `make.bat` and `Makefile` are), type:

```bash
make html
```

The site should be in `docs/build/html/index.html`. To update after making changes, type:

```bash
make html
```
